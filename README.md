🌾 Farmer Assistance System with AI Chatbot & Weather Insights

📘 Academic Project
Developed during 2nd Year of B.Tech (CSE – Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning)
Self-initiated full-stack and AI-integrated application

📌 Project Overview

The Farmer Assistance System is a full-stack web application designed to support farmers by providing real-time weather information and AI-powered agricultural guidance through an interactive chatbot.

This project combines web development fundamentals, database management, API integration, and Generative AI to create a practical solution addressing real-world agricultural challenges.
